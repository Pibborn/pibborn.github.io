I work as a Post-Doc in the Data Mining group at Johannes Gutenberg-Universität Mainz, under the guidance of [Prof. Stefan Kramer](https://www.datamining.informatik.uni-mainz.de/stefan-kramer/). I am a Principal Investigator for the TOP-ML project, which deals with understanding the trade-offs between properties of machine learning algorithms beyond performance. Before that, I was a PhD. student in the Machine Learning Group at University of Torino, my hometown. [Prof. Roberto Esposito](http://informatica.unito.it/do/docenti.pl/Alias?roberto.esposito#tab-profilo) was my advisor for three years.

My research interests are centered around deep neural networks - I mostly research algorithms to constrain and understand them better. I have published papers about algorithmic fairness, interpretability and connections between them. I care deeply about making sure that AI applications can be beneficial to everyone - or at least not harm anybody.

If you are an undergrad and are interested in working on deep learning, interpretability and fairness please check out the [projects]({{site.baseurl}}/projects) page.
